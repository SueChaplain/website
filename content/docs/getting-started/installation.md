# Installing Appsody

You can install Appsody on your system in a few easy steps by using our binary packages, which are available for macOS&reg;, Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and Windows&reg;.

Because Appsody depends on Docker, ensure that you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) installed and the Docker daemon running on your system.

## Installing on macOS

Follow these steps:

1. If you don't have the Xcode command line tools installed on your system, install them by running `xcode-select --install`.
2. If you don't have Homebrew installed on your system, install it by running `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.
3. To install Appsody, run:

```
brew install appsody/appsody/appsody
```

This command creates a brew tap for the `appsody/appsody` repo and installs the `appsody` formula.

That's all there is to it! You can now follow our [Quick Start](#quick-start) instructions to create your first containerized development environment with a running *Hello World!* application.

To remove Appsody, run `brew uninstall appsody`. Optionally, remove the `.appsody` directory that gets created under your home directory: `rm -rf ~/.appsody`.

## Installing on Ubuntu

Follow these steps:

1. Your user account must be a member of the `docker` group, which you can configure by running `sudo usermod -aG docker <username>`.
2. Download the latest **Debian install package** from the [Appsody releases page](https://github.com/appsody/appsody/releases). The file is named `appsody_v.r.m_amd64.deb`, where `v.r.m` indicates the release tag.
3. To install the package, run:

```
sudo apt install -f <path>/appsody_v.r.m_amd64.deb
```
Where `<path>` is the fully qualified path to the package.

That's all there is to it! You can now follow our [Quick Start](#docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) instructions to create your first containerized development environment with a running *Hello World!* application.

To remove Appsody, run `sudo apt remove appsody`. Optionally, remove the `.appsody` directory that gets created under your home directory: `rm -rf ~/.appsody`.

## Installing on RHEL

Follow these steps:

1. Your user account must be a member of the `docker` group, which you can configure by running `sudo usermod -aG docker <username>`.
2. Download the latest **RPM install package** from the [Appsody releases page](https://github.com/appsody/appsody/releases). The file is named `appsody-v.r.m-1.x86_64.rpm`, where `v.r.m` indicates the release tag.
3. To install the package, run:

```
sudo yum install <path>/appsody-v.r.m-1.x86_64.rpm
```

Where `<path>` is the fully qualified path to the package.

That's all there is to it! You can now follow our [Quick Start](#docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) instructions to create your first containerized development environment with a running *Hello World!* application.

To remove Appsody, run `sudo yum remove appsody`. Optionally, remove the `.appsody` directory that gets created under your home directory: `rm -rf ~/.appsody`.

## Installing on Windows

Note: Appsody runs only on Windows 10.

Follow these steps:

1. Create a directory for Appsody on your Windows 10 system.
2. Download the **Appsody binaries for Windows**Â from the [Appsody releases page](https://github.com/appsody/appsody/releases) into the directory. The file is named `appsody-v.r.m-windows.tar`, where `v.r.m` indicates the release tag.
3. Extract the files by running `tar -xvf appsody-v.r.m-windows.tar`.
4. To install Appsody, run the following setup command:

```
appsody-setup.bat
```

That's all there is to it! You can now follow our [Quick Start](#docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) instructions to create your first containerized development environment with a running *Hello World!* application.

To uninstall Appsody, delete the directory where you extracted the binaries. Optionally, remove the `.appsody` directory that gets created under your home folder and the **PATH** entry that was created by the setup command (see [Modifying the PATH on Windows 10](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)).
